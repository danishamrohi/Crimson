Similar to traditional mobile RPGs and mobile gacha games that implement loot box or summoning mechanics, Crimson incorporates a similar philosophy. The primary goal of the player is to battle monsters in order to collect characters and equip them with assets that buff their stats.

## Gameplay:
The player’s primary goal is to quote on quote “collect” characters. They have the ability to shop for items for characters based on drops from monsters. You start the game by giving a name to your protagonist. You can go to battle by clicking on "Fight in Battle" in the main menu. There is two regions. Camelot region is harder than Mount Olympus region. Camelot region should be locked in the beginning and it is unlocked after beating Mount Olympus' boss monster. Since this is a demo, Camelot region is unlocked to begin with. There is an unique regular monster and an unique boss monster for each region. The chance to encounter a boss monster is 25%. At the beginning, the player can not defeat the boss monster, so they must run away if encountered one. They must defeat regular monsters first to buy upgrades, items, and unlock new characters. After defeating a regular monster, the player gains gold and shards. In the shop, the player can use gold to buy healing potions, power ups, and upgrades to a hero's stats. All upgrades are only given to the currently selected hero. Player can switch their main hero by clicking on "View Heroes" in the main menu. The player can use shards to unlock new characters in the Summoning Portal. Summoning Portal summons new hero based on the banner the player have selected. The banner also gives the player bonus stats. Player can switch their banner by clicking on "Change Banner" in the main menu. As for the combat, player can only use their selected hero in a fight. The player can see a hero character, an enemy character, hero's health, enemy's health, combat items, and four buttons on the screen during combat. All characters are animated and there is seven characters in total. There is three heroes, two regular monsters, and two boss monsters. All characters have both an idle animation and an attack animation. In combat, both the attack button and the run button are self explanatory. The player can click on the power button to use power up. The player can click on the heal button to use healing potion. There is a demo mode that adds a lot of gold and shards for the user to test the game.
